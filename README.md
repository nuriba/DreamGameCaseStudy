# DreamGameCaseStudy
This repository includes several files and folders to create a blast game as described in the PDF. To run this game, download repository then open it on Unity. After you open the project, go to Game/Scenes Folder and click on Main Screen. You can select which level you want to play by using Dream Games Editor Menu Tool at top. After you did all of them, you can run the scene. 
Important Note: Game doesn't work properly. You can't play the game, you can just see the game screens and related features. It can load level information, scenes etc. But there is a problem with scaling and game mechanism.
